### Increase Logging Verbosity
Stagehand comes with three verbosity levels (`0`, `1`, `2`). The lowest verbosity level (`verbose: 0`) will only log errors, and the highest level (`verbose: 2`) will log debugging info.
```typescript
const stagehand = new Stagehand({
  env: "LOCAL",
  verbose: 2,
});
```

### Logging Inference to a File
<Note>
logging inference to a file will not work when `useAPI: true`. If you are running your script on Browserbase, ensure you have `useAPI: false` in your Stagehand constructor.
</Note>
Stagehand allows you to log inference calls for `act`, `extract`, and `observe` to a file on your machine.
You can think of it as a conversation history between Stagehand and the LLM. Here is how you can configure it in your Stagehand constructor:
```typescript
const stagehand = new Stagehand({
  env: "LOCAL",
  verbose: 2,
  logInferenceToFile: true,
});
```

Once your script has finished, you will see a directory called `inference_summary` which will contain subdirectories for each Stagehand primitive that was called.

```
inference_summary
├── act_summary
│   ├── 20250821_234942405_act_call.txt
│   ├── 20250821_234943818_act_response.txt
│   └── act_summary.json
├── extract_summary
│   ├── 20250821_235005068_extract_call.txt
│   ├── 20250821_235005734_extract_response.txt
│   ├── 20250821_235005735_metadata_call.txt
│   ├── 20250821_235007040_metadata_response.txt
│   └── extract_summary.json
└── observe_summary
   ├── 20250821_234949455_observe_call.txt
   ├── 20250821_235004517_observe_response.txt
   └── observe_summary.json
```
You can look at each of these files to see the exact inputs & outputs for all of the LLM calls.

### Using the Chrome Devtool UI
The [Chrome Devtools UI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview) is an extremely useful debugging tool.
If Stagehand is unable to take an action or extract some information from a page, you can open up the Chrome Devtools UI
to see whether that element was in an iframe, shadow dom, etc.
<br />
You can also [copy the XPath](https://devtoolstips.org/tips/en/copy-element-xpath/) of an element from the Chrome Devtools UI, paste it into the `selector` field in an `ObserveResult` object, and pass that object into `act`. For example:
```TypeScript
const observeResult = {
  description: "the submit button",
  method: "click",
  selector: "xpath=/html/body/div/div/button",
  arguments: [""]
}
await page.act(observeResult);
```
