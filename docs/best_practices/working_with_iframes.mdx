title: Working with iframes

### What is an iframe?

Iframes embed other pages within your current page. Sites use them for consent banners, payment widgets, chat bubbles, and third-party content.
Elements inside iframes exist in a separate context than the main page.

### Enable iframe support

Set `iframes: true` in your `act()` and `observe()` commands.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Act within iframes
await page.act({ action: "click the accept cookies button", iframes: true });

// Observe within iframes
const results = await page.observe({
  instruction: "Find the primary action button",
  iframes: true,
});
```

```python Python
# Act within iframes
await page.act(
    "click the accept cookies button",
    iframes=True
)

# Observe within iframes
results = await page.observe({
    "instruction": "Find the primary action button",
    "iframes": True,
})
```
</CodeGroup>

### Tips

- Prefer planning with `observe({ iframes: true })` when you are unsure whether an element is in an iframe.
- If an element intermittently fails to be found, it may be inside a transient or lazy‑loaded iframe. Add small waits between steps or re‑run `observe()`.
- For cross‑origin iframes, visibility or timing constraints may differ from the top page. Use focused, single‑step actions and consider `observe()` + cached actions for reliability.

<Note>
You can enable experimental features (like Shadow DOM support) via your Stagehand configuration. See the [configuration guide](/configuration/environment).
