## What is `observe()`?
``` typescript
await page.observe("Find the login button")
```

Calling `observe` turns any page into a checklist of reliable, executable actions. It discovers key elements, ranks likely next steps, and returns structured actions (selector, method, args) you can run instantly with `act` or use to precisely target `extract`—so workflows are faster, cheaper, and more resilient.

## Why use `observe`?

## Using `observe()`

Calling `observe` supercharges other Stagehand methods. Use it to plan workflows, speed up `act`, and precisely target `extract`.

### Observe with Act

Using `observe` helps you explore what's possible on a page by giving you a list of suggested actions.

<Note>
**Performance Tip**: Acting on multiple `observe` suggestions will minimize the number of LLM calls for multi-step actions and speed up your workflow 2-3x.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Plan & validate
const buttons = await page.observe("Find the log in / sign up buttons");
```
```python Python
# Plan & validate
buttons = await page.observe("Find the log in / sign up buttons")
```
</CodeGroup>

This will return a list of suggestions with the following structure
```json
{
  "selector": "xpath=/html/body/header/div/button[1]",
  "description": "Log in button in the top right corner",
  "method": "click",
  "arguments": []
}
```
You can **validate** the action (method, selector, arguments...) and then pass it to `act` to **avoid extra LLM inference**.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
await page.act(buttons[0]); // No LLM!
```
```python Python
await page.act(buttons[0]) # No LLM!
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Plan ahead

You can use multiple suggestions from `observe` to preview a batch of actions. For example, when filling a form you could ask `observe` to find all the fields and then pass them in to `act`. **Call the LLM once, act multiple times**.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const fields = await page.observe("Find all the fields in the form");
for (const field of fields) {
  await page.act(field); // No LLM!
}
```
```python Python
fields = await page.observe("Find all the fields in the form")
for field in fields:
  await page.act(field) # No LLM!
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Remember actions

Most websites don't change often, they keep the same layout/structure. You can store your `observe` results in a cache and reuse them for future runs. 
As long as the page doesn't change the action will be the same, if the page changes [self-healing](/basics/act) will loop the LLM back in so you don't have to maintain your script.

### Observe and Extract

Using `observe` to focus `extract` on a specific section of the page (like a table, a form, a list...) minimizes the context needed for an extraction. 
<Tip>
**Savings Tip**: Pass the selector to `extract` to reduce LLM token usage by 10x for verbose websites!
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Use observe to validate elements before extraction
const [ table ] = await page.observe("Find the data table");

const { data } = await page.extract({
  instruction: "Extract data from the table",
  schema: z.object({
    data: z.string()
  }),
  selector: table.selector // Reduce context scope needed for extraction
});
```
```python Python
# Use observe to validate elements before extraction
[ table ] = await page.observe("Find the data table")

extraction = await page.extract(
  "Extract data from the table",
  schema=Data, # Pydantic schema
  selector=table.selector # Reduce context scope needed for extraction
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

- **Discover and plan with `observe`**: Use `observe("Find…")` to map actionable elements and preview next steps before you act.
- **Act on suggestions to skip LLM calls**: Pass `ObserveResult` objects directly to `act` (e.g., `await page.act(results[0])`) to avoid extra inference and speed up multi-step flows.
- **Draw the line: action vs. info**
  - If a yes/no answer will gate an action, use `observe` (e.g., "Find the Submit button"); then conditionally `act`.
  - If you just need information (not to act), use `extract` (e.g., "What’s the page title?", "How many results are listed?").
- **Scope `extract` with selectors from `observe`**: First `observe("Find the data table")`, then pass `selector` to `extract` to reduce tokens and boost accuracy.
- **Batch for performance**: Call `observe` once (e.g., find all form fields), then `act` on each suggestion to fill/submit without repeated LLM calls.
- **Validate before critical actions**: Review the suggestion’s `method`, `selector`, and `arguments` to avoid misclicks and flaky runs.
- **Cache and reuse**: Store stable `observe` results for known pages; rely on self-healing to recover if layouts shift.
- **Be specific**: Narrow instructions ("Find the primary CTA in the hero") yield faster, cheaper, more accurate suggestions.
- **Mind iframes and load**: If elements live in an iframe, set `iframes: true`, and wait for `networkidle` before observing.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="No elements found">
**Problem**: `observe()` returns empty array

**Solutions**:
- Make sure the element exists on the page
- Use explicit instructions to find the element
- Ensure page has fully loaded
- Look at the [debugging workflows](/best-practices/debugging-workflows) logs, if the element is there then the LLM might be hallucinating/not catching it. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Inaccurate element descriptions">
**Problem**: Descriptions don't match actual elements

**Solutions**:
- Use more capable models: check [evals](https://stagehand.dev/evals) for the best models for your use case
- Provide more specific instructions
- Log inference to file (see [debugging workflows](/best-practices/debugging-workflows)) to get an LLM trace

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Wrong method identified">
**Problem**: The method identified is not valid

**Solutions**:
- Check the [supported actions](/basics/act)
- Provide more specific instructions
- Validate the method, if invalid override with one of the supported ones
