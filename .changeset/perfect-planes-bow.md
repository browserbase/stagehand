Added eslint for stricter type checking. Streamlined most of the internal types throughout the cache, llm, and handlers. This should make it easier to add new LLMs down the line, maintain and update the existing code, and make it easier to add new features in the future. Types can be checked by running `npx eslint .` from the project directory.
