# Running Scripts

To run the main Twitter monitoring script ([examples/twitter_simple_monitor.ts](mdc:examples/twitter_simple_monitor.ts)), please use the following command:

```bash
npm run twitter-simple-monitor
```

This is the recommended method because the script defined in [package.json](mdc:package.json) includes the necessary build step (`npm run build`) before executing the script with `tsx`. Running the script directly with `tsx` or `ts-node` might fail if the project hasn't been built recently.
