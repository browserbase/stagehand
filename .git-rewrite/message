Informed error parsing from api (#1327)

## Why:
Errors were being wrapped under an opaque stagehand server error. This
PR helps provide clearer, actionable errors.

## What:
- On system events with status=error, throw new Error with the server
message.
- In the catch block, rethrow non-SyntaxError Errors; only wrap
JSON.parse SyntaxError as StagehandResponseParseError.

## Test Plan:
- [x] Unit test: status=error yields a plain Error with the raw server
message.
- [x] Unit test: invalid JSON is wrapped as StagehandResponseParseError.
