> [!NOTE] 
> `Stagehand` is currently available as an early release, and we're actively seeking feedback from the community. Please join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/stagehand-dev/shared_invite/zt-2tdncfgkk-fF8y5U0uJzR2y2_M9c9OJA) to stay updated on the latest developments and provide feedback.

Stagehand is the easiest way to build browser automations. It is completely interoperable with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and has seamless integration with [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com/).

It offers three simple AI APIs (`act`, `extract`, and `observe`) on top of the base Playwright `Page` class that provide the building blocks for web automation via natural language.

Anything that can be done in a browser can be done with Stagehand. Think about stuff like:

1. Log into Amazon, search for AirPods, and buy the most relevant product
1. Go to Hacker News and extract the top stories of the day
1. Go to Doordash, find the cheapest pad thai, and order it to your house

These automations can be built with Playwright, but it can be very cumbersome to write the code, and it will be very vulnerable to minor changes in the UI.

Stagehand, especially when combined with Browserbaseâ€™s stealth mode, makes it easier to write durable code and bypass bot detection and captchas.

# Documentation

Visit [docs.stagehand.dev](https://docs.stagehand.dev) to view the full documentation.

# Getting Started

### Quickstart

You can run `npx create-browser-app` to create a new Stagehand project configured to our default settings.

Read our [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.stagehand.dev/get_started/quickstart) in the docs for more information.

### Build and Run from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand.git
cd stagehand
npm install
npx playwright install
npm run example # run the blank script at ./examples/example.ts
```

### Environment Variables

Stagehand is best when you have an API key for an LLM provider and Browserbase credentials. To add these to your project, run:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env # Edit the .env file to add API keys
```

# Roadmap

At a high level, we're focused on improving reliability, speed, and cost in that order of priority.

# Contributing

> [!NOTE]  
> We highly value contributions to Stagehand! For support or code review, please join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/stagehand-dev/shared_invite/zt-2tdncfgkk-fF8y5U0uJzR2y2_M9c9OJA).


## Acknowledgements

This project heavily relies on [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as a resilient backbone to automate the web. It also would not be possible without the awesome techniques and discoveries made by [tarsier](https://github.com/reworkd/tarsier), and [fuji-web](https://github.com/normal-computing/fuji-web).

[Jeremy Press](https://x.com/jeremypress) wrote the original MVP of Stagehand and continues to be a major ally to the project.
