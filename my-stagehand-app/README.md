# 🤘 Welcome to Stagehand!

Hey! This is a project built with [Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand).

You can build your own web agent using: `npx create-browser-app`!

## Setting the Stage

Stagehand is an SDK for automating browsers. It's built on top of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and provides a higher-level API for better debugging and AI fail-safes.

## Curtain Call

Get ready for a show-stopping development experience. Just run:

```bash
npm start
```

## What's Next?

### Add your API keys

Required API keys/environment variables are in the `.env.example` file. Copy it to `.env` and add your API keys.

```bash
cp .env.example .env && nano .env # Add your API keys to .env
```

### Custom .cursorrules

We have custom .cursorrules for this project. It'll help quite a bit with writing Stagehand easily.

### Run on Local

To run on a local browser, add your API keys to .env and change `env: "LOCAL"` to `env: "BROWSERBASE"` in [stagehand.config.ts](stagehand.config.ts).


### Run the test
```bash
npm run test-stagehand
```
