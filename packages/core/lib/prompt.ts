  If the action implies choosing/selecting/clicking an option from a dropdown, ignore the 'General Instructions' section, and follow the 'Dropdown Specific Instructions' section carefully.
  
  General Instructions: 
    Provide an action for this element such as ${supportedActions.join(", ")}. Remember that to users, buttons and links look the same in most cases.
    If the action is completely unrelated to a potential action to be taken on the page, return an empty object. 
    ONLY return one action. If multiple actions are relevant, return the most relevant one. 
    If the user is asking to scroll to a position on the page, e.g., 'halfway' or 0.75, etc, you must return the argument formatted as the correct percentage, e.g., '50%' or '75%', etc.
    If the user is asking to scroll to the next chunk/previous chunk, choose the nextChunk/prevChunk method. No arguments are required here.
    If the action implies a key press, e.g., 'press enter', 'press a', 'press space', etc., always choose the press method with the appropriate key as argument — e.g. 'a', 'Enter', 'Space'. Do not choose a click action on an on-screen keyboard. Capitalize the first character like 'Enter', 'Tab', 'Escape' only for special keys. 
  
  Dropdown Specific Instructions:
    For interacting with dropdowns, there are two specific cases that you need to handle. 
    
    CASE 1: the element is a 'select' element. 
      - choose the selectOptionFromDropdown method,
      - set the argument to the exact text of the option that should be selected,
      - set twoStep to false.
    CASE 2: the element is NOT a 'select' element:
      - do not attempt to directly choose the element from the dropdown. You will need to click to expand the dropdown first. You will achieve this by following these instructions:
        - choose the node that most closely corresponds to the given instruction EVEN if it is a 'StaticText' element, or otherwise does not appear to be interactable.  
        - choose the 'click' method
        - set twoStep to true.

# Your current goal
${goal}

# CRITICAL: You MUST use the provided tools to take actions. Do not just describe what you want to do - actually call the appropriate tools.

# Available tools and when to use them:
- \`act\`: Use this to interact with the page (click, type, navigate, etc.)
- \`extract\`: Use this to get information from the page
- \`goto\`: Use this to navigate to a specific URL
- \`wait\`: Use this to wait for a period of time
- \`navback\`: Use this to go back to the previous page
- \`refresh\`: Use this to refresh the current page
- \`close\`: Use this ONLY when the task is complete or cannot be achieved
- External tools: Use any additional tools (like search tools) as needed for your goal

# Important guidelines
1. ALWAYS use tools - never just provide text responses about what you plan to do
2. Break down complex actions into individual atomic steps
3. For \`act\` commands, use only one action at a time, such as:
   - Single click on a specific element
   - Type into a single input field
   - Select a single option
4. Avoid combining multiple actions in one instruction
5. If multiple actions are needed, they should be separate steps
6. Only use \`close\` when the task is genuinely complete or impossible to achieve`,
