# Stagehand + Browserbase: Context Authentication Example

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: demonstrate persistent authentication using Browserbase **contexts** that survive across sessions.
- Flow: create context → log in once → persist cookies/tokens → reuse context in a new session → extract data → clean up.
- Benefits: skip re-auth on subsequent runs, reduce MFA prompts, speed up protected flows, and keep state stable across retries.

## GLOSSARY

- context: a persistent browser state (cookies, localStorage, cache) stored server-side and reusable by new sessions.
  Docs → https://docs.browserbase.com/features/contexts
- persist: when true, any state changes during a session are written back to the context for future reuse.
- act: perform UI actions from a prompt (click, type, navigate).

## QUICKSTART

1. cd context
2. npm install
3. npm install axios
4. cp .env.example .env
5. Add your Browserbase API key, Project ID, and SF Rec Park credentials to .env
6. npm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Creates context, performs login, saves auth state
- Reuses context in new session to access authenticated pages
- Extracts user data using structured schemas
- Cleans up context after completion

## COMMON PITFALLS

- "Cannot find module": ensure all dependencies are installed
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains all required variables
- Context persistence: ensure persist: true is set to save login state

## USE CASES

• Persistent login sessions: Automate workflows that require authentication without re-logging in every run.
• Access to gated content: Crawl or extract data from behind login walls (e.g., booking portals, dashboards, intranets).
• Multi-step workflows: Maintain cookies/tokens across different automation steps or scheduled jobs.

## NEXT STEPS

• Extend to multiple apps: Reuse the same context across different authenticated websites within one session.
• Add session validation: Extract and verify account info (e.g., username, profile details) to confirm successful auth.
• Secure lifecycle: Rotate, refresh, and delete contexts programmatically to enforce security policies.
