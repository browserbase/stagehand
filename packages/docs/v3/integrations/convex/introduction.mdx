## Overview

This guide shows you how to use Stagehand with Convex to create AI-powered browser automation within your Convex applications. By the end of this guide, you'll know how to:

- Set up the convex-stagehand component in your Convex app
- Extract structured data from web pages using natural language
- Execute browser actions via plain English instructions
- Build autonomous multi-step workflows with the agent API

## When You'd Use This

The Convex integration is perfect for scenarios where you need browser automation in serverless Convex functions:

- **Data extraction pipelines**: Extract structured data from websites and store it directly in your Convex database
- **Automated workflows**: Build background jobs that interact with web pages on behalf of users
- **Form automation**: Automatically fill out and submit forms based on data from your Convex app
- **Multi-step web processes**: Execute complex browser workflows that require decision-making and adaptation

The integration wraps the Stagehand REST API to provide Convex actions with the ability to control cloud browsers via Browserbase:

1. **Act**: Perform actions like clicking, typing, or navigating using natural language
2. **Extract**: Extract structured data from web pages with Zod schemas
3. **Observe**: Identify and analyze interactive elements on the page
4. **Agent**: Run autonomous multi-step tasks with AI decision-making
