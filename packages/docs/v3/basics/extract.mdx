## What is `extract()`?

```typescript
stagehand.extract("extract the name of the repository");
```

`extract` grabs structured data from a webpage. You can define your schema with [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) (TypeScript) or JSON. If you do not want to define a schema, you can also call `extract` with just a [natural language prompt](#extract-with-just-a-prompt), or call `extract` [with no parameters](#extract-with-no-parameters).

## Using `extract()`

### Single Value Extraction

Here is how an `extract` call might look for a single value:

```typescript
const price = await stagehand.extract(
  "extract the price of the item",
  z.number()
);
```

Your output will be:
```Example
19.99
```

### Array Extraction

Here is how an `extract` call might look for extracting an array of objects:

```typescript
const apartments = await stagehand.extract(
  "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details, including address, price, and square feet.",
  z.array(
    z.object({
      address: z.string(),
      price: z.string(),
      square_feet: z.string(),
    })
  )
);

console.log("the apartment list is: ", apartments);
```

Your output will be:
```Example
[
  {
    address: "street address here",
    price: "$1234.00",
    square_feet: "700"
  },
  {
    address: "another address here",
    price: "1010.00",
    square_feet: "500"
  },
  ...
]
```

### Prompt-only Extraction

You can call `extract` with just a natural language prompt:

```typescript
const result = await stagehand.extract("extract the name of the repository");
```

When you call `extract` with just a prompt, your output schema will look like:
```Example
{ extraction: string }
```

### Extract with no parameters

Here is how you can call `extract` with no parameters.

```typescript
const pageText = await stagehand.extract();
```

Output schema:
```Example
{ pageText: string }
```

Calling `extract` with no parameters will return hierarchical tree representation of the root DOM. This will not be passed through an LLM. It will look something like this:

```
Accessibility Tree:
[0-2] RootWebArea: What is Stagehand? - ðŸ¤˜ Stagehand
  [0-37] scrollable
    [0-118] body
      [0-241] scrollable
        [0-242] div
          [0-244] link: ðŸ¤˜ Stagehand home page light logo
            [0-245] span
              [0-246] StaticText: ðŸ¤˜ Stagehand
              [0-247] StaticText: home page
```

## Best practices


### Extract with Context

You can provide additional context to your schema to help the model extract the data more accurately.

```typescript
const apartments = await stagehand.extract(
  "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details, including address, price, and square feet.",
  z.array(
    z.object({
      address: z.string().describe("the address of the apartment"),
      price: z.string().describe("the price of the apartment"),
      square_feet: z.string().describe("the square footage of the apartment"),
    })
  )
);
```

### Link Extraction
<Note>
To extract links or URLs, define the relevant field as `z.string().url()`.
</Note>

Here is how an `extract` call might look for extracting a link or URL. This also works for image links.

```typescript
const contactLink = await stagehand.extract(
  "extract the link to the 'contact us' page",
  z.string().url() // note the usage of z.string().url() for URL validation
);

console.log("the link to the contact us page is: ", contactLink);
```

<Tip>
Inside Stagehand, extracting links works by asking the LLM to select an ID. Stagehand looks up that ID in a mapping of IDs -> URLs. When logging the LLM trace, you should expect to see IDs. The actual URLs will be included in the final `ExtractResult`.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Empty or partial results">
**Problem**: `extract()` returns empty or incomplete data

**Solutions**:
- **Check your instruction clarity**: Make sure your instruction is specific and describes exactly what data you want to extract
- **Verify the data exists**: Use `stagehand.observe()` first to confirm the data is present on the page
- **Wait for dynamic content**: If the page loads content dynamically, use `stagehand.act("wait for the content to load")` before extracting

**Solution: Wait for content before extracting**
```typescript
// Wait for content before extracting
await stagehand.act("wait for the product listings to load");
const products = await stagehand.extract(
  "extract all product names and prices",
  z.object({
    products: z.array(z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      price: z.string()
    }))
  })
);
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Schema validation errors">
**Problem**: Getting schema validation errors or type mismatches

**Solutions**:
- **Use optional fields**: Make fields optional with `z.optional()` if the data might not always be present
- **Use flexible types**: Consider using `z.string()` instead of `z.number()` for prices that might include currency symbols
- **Add descriptions**: Use `.describe()` to help the model understand field requirements

**Solution: More flexible schema**
```typescript
const schema = z.object({
  price: z.string().describe("price including currency symbol, e.g., '$19.99'"),
  availability: z.string().optional().describe("stock status if available"),
  rating: z.number().optional()
});
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Inconsistent results">
**Problem**: Extraction results vary between runs

**Solutions**:
- **Be more specific in instructions**: Instead of "extract prices", use "extract the numerical price value for each item"
- **Use context in schema descriptions**: Add field descriptions to guide the model
- **Combine with observe**: Use `stagehand.observe()` to understand the page structure first

**Solution: Validate with observe first**
```typescript
// First observe to understand the page structure
const elements = await stagehand.observe("find all product listings");
console.log("Found elements:", elements.map(e => e.description));

// Then extract with specific targeting
const products = await stagehand.extract(
  "extract name and price from each product listing shown on the page",
  z.array(z.object({
    name: z.string().describe("the product title or name"),
    price: z.string().describe("the price as displayed, including currency")
  }))
);
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance issues">
**Problem**: Extraction is slow or timing out

**Solutions**:
- **Reduce scope**: Extract smaller chunks of data in multiple calls rather than everything at once
- **Use targeted instructions**: Be specific about which part of the page to focus on
- **Consider pagination**: For large datasets, extract one page at a time
- **Increase timeout**: Use `timeoutMs` parameter for complex extractions

**Solution: Break down large extractions**
```typescript
// Instead of extracting everything at once
const allData = [];
const pageNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const ProductSchema = z.array(z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  price: z.number()
}));

for (const pageNum of pageNumbers) {
  await stagehand.act(`navigate to page ${pageNum}`);

  const pageData = await stagehand.extract(
    "extract product data from the current page only",
    ProductSchema,
    { timeout: 60000 } // 60 second timeout
  );

  allData.push(...pageData);
}
```
