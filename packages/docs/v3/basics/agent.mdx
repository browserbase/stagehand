## What is `agent()?`

``` typescript
await agent.execute("apply for a job at browserbase")
```
`agent` turns high level tasks into **fully autonomous** browser workflows. You can customize the agent by specifying the LLM provider and model, setting custom instructions for behavior, and configuring max steps.

## Using `agent()`

There are two ways to create agents in Stagehand:
1. Use a Computer Use Agent
2. Use Agent with any LLM (non-computer-use)

### Computer Use Agents

You can use specialized computer use models from either Google, OpenAI, or Anthropic as shown below, with `cua` set to `true`. To compare the performance of different computer use models, you can visit our [evals page](https://www.stagehand.dev/agent-evals).

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Google
const agent = stagehand.agent({
    cua: true,
    model: {
        modelName: "google/gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025",
        apiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY
    },
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant...",
});

await agent.execute({
    instruction: "Go to Hacker News and find the most controversial post from today, then read the top 3 comments and summarize the debate.",
    maxSteps: 20,
    highlightCursor: true
})
```

```typescript OpenAI
const agent = stagehand.agent({
    cua: true,
    model: {
        modelName: "openai/computer-use-preview",
        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
    },
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant...",
});

await agent.execute({
    instruction: "Go to Hacker News and find the most controversial post from today, then read the top 3 comments and summarize the debate.",
    maxSteps: 20,
    highlightCursor: true
})
```
```typescript Anthropic
const agent = stagehand.agent({
    cua: true,
    model: {
        modelName: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    },
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant...",
});

await agent.execute({
    instruction: "Go to Hacker News and find the most controversial post from today, then read the top 3 comments and summarize the debate.",
    maxSteps: 20,
    highlightCursor: true
})
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Stagehand Agent with Any LLM

Use the agent without specifying a provider to utilize any model or LLM provider:

<Note>Non CUA agents are currently only supported in TypeScript</Note>

```typescript TypeScript
const agent = stagehand.agent();
await agent.execute("apply for a job at Browserbase")
```
<Card title="Available Agent Models" icon="robot" href="/v3/configuration/models#agent-models-with-cua-support">

</Card>

### Return value of `agent()`?

When you use `agent()`, Stagehand will return a `Promise<AgentResult>` with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  success: true,
  message: "The first name and email fields have been filled successfully with 'John' and 'john@example.com'.",
  actions: [
    {
      type: 'ariaTree',
      reasoning: undefined,
      taskCompleted: true,
      pageUrl: 'https://example.com',
      timestamp: 1761598722055
    },
    {
      type: 'act',
      reasoning: undefined,
      taskCompleted: true,
      action: 'type "John" into the First Name textbox',
      playwrightArguments: {...},
      pageUrl: 'https://example.com',
      timestamp: 1761598731643
    },
    {
      type: 'close',
      reasoning: "The first name and email fields have been filled successfully.",
      taskCompleted: true,
      taskComplete: true,
      pageUrl: 'https://example.com',
      timestamp: 1761598732861
    }
  ],
  completed: true,
  usage: {
    input_tokens: 2040,
    output_tokens: 28,
    inference_time_ms: 14079
  }
}
```

## MCP Integrations

Agents can be enhanced with external tools and services through MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations. This allows your agent to access external APIs and data sources beyond just browser interactions.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Pass URL
const agent = stagehand.agent({
    cua: true,
    model: {
        modelName: "openai/computer-use-preview",
        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
    },
    integrations: [
      `https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=${process.env.EXA_API_KEY}`,
    ],
    systemPrompt: `You have access to web search through Exa. Use it to find current information before browsing.`
});

await agent.execute("Search for the best headphones of 2025 and go through checkout for the top recommendation");
```

```typescript Create Connection
import { connectToMCPServer } from "@browserbasehq/stagehand";

const supabaseClient = await connectToMCPServer(
  `https://server.smithery.ai/@supabase-community/supabase-mcp/mcp?api_key=${process.env.SMITHERY_API_KEY}`
);

const agent = stagehand.agent({
    cua: true,
    model: {
        modelName: "openai/computer-use-preview",
        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
    },
    integrations: [supabaseClient],
    systemPrompt: `You can interact with Supabase databases. Use these tools to store and retrieve data.`
});

await agent.execute("Search for restaurants and save the first result to the database");
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
MCP integrations enable agents to be more powerful by combining browser automation with external APIs, databases, and services. The agent can intelligently decide when to use browser actions versus external tools.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Stagehand uses a 1288x711 viewport by default (the optimal size for Computer Use Agents). Other viewport sizes may reduce performance. If you need to modify the viewport, you can edit in the [Browser Configuration](/v3/configuration/browser).
</Warning>

## Agent Execution Configuration

Control the maximum number of steps the agent can take to complete the task using the `maxSteps` parameter.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Set maxSteps to control how many actions the agent can take
await agent.execute({
  instruction: "Sign me up for a library card",
  maxSteps: 15 // Agent will stop after 15 steps if task isn't complete
});
```

For complex tasks, increase the `maxSteps` limit and check task success.

```typescript
// Complex multi-step task requiring more actions
const result = await agent.execute({
  instruction: "Find and apply for software engineering jobs, filtering by remote work and saving 3 applications",
  maxSteps: 30, // Higher limit for complex workflows
});

// Check if the task completed successfully
if (result.success === true) {
  console.log("Task completed successfully!");
} else {
  console.log("Task failed or was incomplete");
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

Following these best practices will improve your agent's success rate, reduce execution time, and minimize unexpected errors during task completion.

### Start on the Right Page
Navigate to your target page before executing tasks:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Do this">
```typescript
await page.goto('https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand');
await agent.execute('Get me the latest PR on the stagehand repo');
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Don't do this">
```typescript
await agent.execute('Go to GitHub and find the latest PR on browserbase/stagehand');
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Be Specific
Provide detailed instructions for better results:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Do this">
```typescript
await agent.execute("Find Italian restaurants in Brooklyn that are open after 10pm and have outdoor seating");
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Don't do this">
```typescript
await agent.execute("Find a restaurant");
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>


<Accordion title="Agent is stopping before completing the task">
**Problem**: Agent stops before finishing the requested task

**Solutions**:
- Check if the agent is hitting the maxSteps limit (default is 20)
- Increase maxSteps for complex tasks: `maxSteps: 30` or higher
- Break very complex tasks into smaller sequential executions

```typescript
// Increase maxSteps for complex tasks
await agent.execute({
  instruction: "Complete the multi-page registration form with all required information",
  maxSteps: 40 // Increased limit for complex task
});

// Or break into smaller tasks with success checking
const firstResult = await agent.execute({
  instruction: "Fill out page 1 of the registration form", 
  maxSteps: 15
});

// Only proceed if the first task was successful
if (firstResult.success === true) {
  await agent.execute({
    instruction: "Navigate to page 2 and complete remaining fields",
    maxSteps: 15
  });
} else {
  console.log("First task failed, stopping execution");
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent is failing to click the proper elements">
**Problem**: Agent clicks on wrong elements or fails to interact with the correct UI components

**Solutions**:
- Ensure proper viewport size: Stagehand uses `1288x711` by default (optimal for Computer Use models)
- Avoid changing viewport dimensions as other sizes may reduce performance
