{/* 
  V3Banner - Currently a no-op component
  
  This component is imported across 50+ pages in v3 docs.
  Keeping it as a no-op rather than removing allows us to easily 
  add a new banner message in the future without editing every file.
  
  To add a banner, replace the null return with your JSX content.
